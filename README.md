# The-Sameness
What is this?
        This is a digital visual narrative created by David Moore, a senior computer science student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The unique art direction is inspired by Scott McCloud's explanation of the "expressive potential" of lines in his work, <i>Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art.</i> The narrative is computed through Javascript code that takes SVG paths as input, and then converts the data to a set of functions through a fourier transform. Each function consists of 425 cosine functions. The summation of these functions results in a graphable fourier series. I then graphed this series using the p5.js library and synced music and my voice with the narrative. I hope that by allowing the lines to come to life this piece includes the audience in the creative process. In this way, the audience is the one running the program and is thus the one who drew the artwork they are viewing. Furthermore, I hope that the kinetic energy of the lines allows them to be as expressive as McCloud described and creates a very dynamic piece. Finally, even though this art is created purely through math and computed by a souless machine, I belive that the lines still convey human emotion and hopefully prompt an emotional response. The narrative conveys humanity because there is a wizard behind the curtain of this program who lovingly crafted this piece. I hope you enjoy my narrative!
